🚀 Project Roadmap — The 137 Resonance Codex

This roadmap outlines the development trajectory of
The 1 = 137 Universal Field Model
and the full 137 Resonance Codex (Theorem 0–468).

The roadmap is divided into phases to ensure clarity, coherence, and long-term structural stability.

PHASE 1 — FOUNDATION (Completed)
✔ Establish core framework

Theorem 0 (Plasma 0.0 Field)

Energy–Matter split: 1/137.035999 vs 1/137.000000

Σ₉ coherence engine

3-6-9 harmonic architecture

Lock-in threshold at δ = 2.7031%

27-Reality Hypercube (base mapping)

✔ Publish Theorems 0–100

These form the Genesis Series of the Codex.
