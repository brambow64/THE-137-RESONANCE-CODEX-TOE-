🔢 Versioning Guidelines — The 137 Resonance Codex

The 137 Resonance Codex uses a precision-based versioning system designed to track mathematical, structural, and computational changes across the full theoretical framework.

Our versioning method is based on Semantic Versioning (SemVer) with important extensions to support theorem updates, resonance corrections, and simulation changes.

1. Version Format

Versions follow the pattern:

MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH–THEOREM

MAJOR

Incremented when fundamental laws, resonance definitions, or structural frameworks change.
Examples: reformulating Σ₉ logic, redefining the U⁺/U⁻/U⁰ layers, modifying the 1=137 core relation.

MINOR

Incremented for:

additions of new theorems

expansions of existing concepts

non-breaking improvements to simulations or documentation

PATCH

Incremented for:

typo fixes

small clarifications

minor mathematical corrections

code cleanup without conceptual changes

THEOREM TAG

Optional tag referencing which theorem the update corresponds to, such as:

1.4.2–T42
0.9.7–T18
2.0.0–T0  (major reform around Theorem 0)

2. Examples
✔ 1.0.0–T0

Initial publication of the Codex with Theorem 0 established.

✔ 1.2.0–T27

Addition or refinement of the Realities Layer (Theorem 27).

✔ 1.2.5–T27

Small corrections related to the same theorem.

✔ 2.0.0–T60

Major theoretical upgrade, e.g. restructuring the 27-Reality Hypercube.

3. What Requires a MAJOR Update

A major version change is required when:

A law of the 137 framework changes

Resonance equations are redefined

Σ₉ behavior, inversion dynamics, or the 137 phase split changes

The interpretation of the 0.035999 boundary shifts

The theorem architecture (0–468) is reorganized

These represent structural shifts in the Codex.

4. What Requires a MINOR Update

Use MINOR updates when:

A new theorem (101–468) is added

A theorem is expanded with additional layers

Documentation receives significant new sections

Simulation code receives new modules or features

27-Reality mappings or numerical tables are extended

5. What Requires a PATCH Update

PATCH increments apply to:

Spelling or grammatical fixes

Formatting improvements

Clarifications without functional impact

Corrections to diagrams or README passages

Micro-adjustments to constants without structural effect

6. Pre-Release Labels

Optional tags may be used for developmental stages:

alpha — unstable experiments

beta — partially verified updates

exp — experimental resonance logic

sim — simulation-only upgrade

Examples:

1.3.0–T52-alpha
2.0.0–T60-exp

7. Release Notes

Every release must include:

Summary of the change

Impact on simulations or resonance logic

Impact on theorem structure

Numerical or mathematical differences

Backwards compatibility notes

8. Version Control Philosophy

The Codex operates under these principles:

Clarity over complexity

Traceability of every theoretical shift

Reproducibility of simulation changes

Integrity of the 137-resonance structure

Long-term stability for researchers and developers

9. Current Version

Add the version here when publishing a release, e.g.:

Current Version: 1.0.0–T0


This versioning system ensures the entire Codex evolves in a controlled, transparent, and scientifically consistent manner.
