📘 2. How to Contribute
Step 1 — Fork the Repository

Create your own fork and work on your edits there.

Step 2 — Create a Feature Branch

Use a descriptive branch name such as:

feature/sigma9-optimizer
fix/theorem-42-notation
docs/readme-expansion
analysis/reality-map-corrections

Step 3 — Commit Clearly

Write meaningful commit messages, for example:

Added Σ₉ drift correction
Refactored 137 transition logic
Corrected Realities 9–12 mapping
Improved README theorem index
Implemented resonance stability test

Step 4 — Submit a Pull Request (PR)

Your PR must include:

A clear explanation of the change

Why it improves the project

Any mathematical, numerical, or conceptual impact

Relevant test results if applicable

Pull requests are reviewed manually to ensure alignment with the 137 Resonance Codex framework.pplicable)
