      <h3>How to approach the Codex</h3>
      <p>
        The 137 Resonance Codex is a complete field model, not a single paper.  
        To make it accessible, this “Start Here” guide walks you through the most important entry points:
      </p>
      <ul class="list">
        <li>understand the idea of the Codex as a universal map,</li>
        <li>read the core summary in the README,</li>
        <li>explore the Genesis Series (Theorems 0–100),</li>
        <li>and use the tools to see the model in action.</li>
      </ul>
      <p style="margin-top:0.6rem;">
        You do not need to understand every equation on day one.  
        The goal is to see <em>how</em> everything fits together on the 1/137 landscape.

      <h3>4 steps to get started</h3>
      <ol class="list" style="list-style:decimal; padding-left:1.2rem;">
        <li>
          <strong>Read the main README.</strong>  
          Get the high-level picture of the Codex as a universal map.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Download the Theorem Bundle (0–100).</strong>  
          These theorems form the Genesis Series of the model.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Study Theorem 0 carefully.</strong>  
          It contains the full 0.0 plasma field and the complete calculation set under the theorem.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Look at the Tools Build-Up section.</strong>  
          See how the 1=137 Field Modulator, Σ₉ engine and other tools make the Codex operational.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p style="margin-top:0.6rem;">
        After that, you can move deeper into the theorem index, simulations, or specific field layers that match your interest.

    <h3>The Codex in simple words</h3>
    <p>
      The 137 Resonance Codex is a map of how the universe organizes itself.  
      Instead of using many different scientific theories, the Codex shows that everything fits on one structure:
      a single split between two numbers — 1/137.035999 (energy) and 1/137.000000 (matter).
    </p>

    <p style="margin-top:0.6rem;">
      This small difference (0.035999…) creates the boundary between:
    </p>

    <ul class="list">
      <li>what becomes visible,</li>
      <li>what stays invisible,</li>
      <li>when matter appears,</li>
      <li>and how energy behaves.</li>
    </ul>

    <p style="margin-top:0.6rem;">
      All layers of the Codex — the fields, the 27 realities, the Σ₉ engine — sit on this one map.
      If you understand this split, you understand the core idea.
    </p>

    <p style="margin-top:0.6rem;">
      Theorems 0–100 explain how this map works step by step,  
      and the tools on this website let you explore the structure in action.
