      <h3>How to approach the Codex</h3>
      <p>
        The 137 Resonance Codex is a complete field model, not a single paper.  
        To make it accessible, this “Start Here” guide walks you through the most important entry points:
      </p>
      <ul class="list">
        <li>understand the idea of the Codex as a universal map,</li>
        <li>read the core summary in the README,</li>
        <li>explore the Genesis Series (Theorems 0–100),</li>
        <li>and use the tools to see the model in action.</li>
      </ul>
      <p style="margin-top:0.6rem;">
        You do not need to understand every equation on day one.  
        The goal is to see <em>how</em> everything fits together on the 1/137 landscape.

      <h3>4 steps to get started</h3>
      <ol class="list" style="list-style:decimal; padding-left:1.2rem;">
        <li>
          <strong>Read the main README.</strong>  
          Get the high-level picture of the Codex as a universal map.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Download the Theorem Bundle (0–100).</strong>  
          These theorems form the Genesis Series of the model.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Study Theorem 0 carefully.</strong>  
          It contains the full 0.0 plasma field and the complete calculation set under the theorem.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Look at the Tools Build-Up section.</strong>  
          See how the 1=137 Field Modulator, Σ₉ engine and other tools make the Codex operational.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p style="margin-top:0.6rem;">
        After that, you can move deeper into the theorem index, simulations, or specific field layers that match your interest.
