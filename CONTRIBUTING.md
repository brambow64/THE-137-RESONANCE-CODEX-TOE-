🧩 Contributing to The 137 Resonance Codex

Thank you for your interest in contributing to this project.
The 137 Resonance Codex is a hybrid scientific–computational framework that unifies field theory, resonance mechanics, theorem architecture, and simulation logic.
To maintain coherence across all layers, please follow the guidelines below.

📘 1. Types of Contributions

You may contribute in the following areas:

• Theorem Documentation

Refinement, correction, or expansion of theorem structures (0–468).

• Mathematical Models

Improving formulas, structural proofs, numerical stability, or resonance logic.

• Simulation Code

Enhancements to:

the 1=137 Field Modulator,

the Σ₉ Coherence Engine,

or any supporting computational modules.

• Documentation & Explanations

Improvements to the README, diagrams, GitHub Pages content, website text, or explanatory notes.

• Testing & Validation

Running numerical tests, verifying resonance behavior, coherence outcomes, benchmarking transitions, or stress-testing models.

📘 2. How to Contribute
Step 1 — Fork the Repository

Create your own fork and work on your edits there.

Step 2 — Create a Feature Branch

Use a descriptive branch name, for example:

feature/sigma9-optimizer
fix/theorem-42-notation
docs/readme-expansion
analysis/reality-map-corrections

Step 3 — Commit Clearly

Write meaningful commit messages such as:

Added Σ₉ drift correction
Refactored 137 transition logic
Corrected Realities 9–12 mapping
Improved README theorem index
Implemented resonance stability test

Step 4 — Submit a Pull Request (PR)

Your PR must include:

A clear explanation of the change

Why it improves the project

Any mathematical, numerical, or conceptual impact

Relevant test/validation results (if applicable)

All pull requests are manually reviewed to ensure alignment with the 137 Resonance Codex framework.
