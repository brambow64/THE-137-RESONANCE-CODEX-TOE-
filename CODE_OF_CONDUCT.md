🌐 Code of Conduct — The 137 Resonance Codex

To maintain a respectful, collaborative, and scientifically productive environment,
all contributors to The 137 Resonance Codex are expected to follow this Code of Conduct.

This project represents a unified theoretical and computational framework.
Constructive interaction is essential to ensure clarity, accuracy, and coherence across all layers of the model.

1. Expected Behavior

All contributors shall:

✔ Be Respectful

Treat others with professionalism, patience, and courtesy.

✔ Stay Constructive

Provide helpful feedback, grounded reasoning, and clear motivation for changes.

✔ Value Clarity

Ensure explanations, theoretical notes, and code changes are well-documented and coherent.

✔ Honor Scientific Integrity

Base corrections, expansions, and contributions on clear logic, mathematics, evidence, or reproducible reasoning.

✔ Focus on the Work

Debates should revolve around improving the theory, theorems, simulations, documentation, or numerical models — never on personal viewpoints.

2. Unacceptable Behavior

The following behaviors will not be tolerated:

Personal attacks, insults, or harassment

Dismissive or hostile responses

Introducing irrelevant or intentionally disruptive content

Submitting knowingly incorrect information

Misrepresenting another contributor’s work

Violating licensing boundaries

3. Contribution Principles

Every contribution must:

Support the internal structure of the 137 Resonance Codex

Maintain coherence with the theorem architecture (0–468)

Respect the scientific and mathematical foundations of the model

Aim to improve clarity, performance, accuracy, or consistency

Follow the MIT license conditions

4. Conflict Resolution

If disagreements arise:

Seek clarity through calm discussion

Reference the relevant theorems or model sections

Present logical, mathematical, or numerical justification

If unresolved, open a Discussion on GitHub for neutral review

Maintainers may request clarifications or revisions if needed.

5. Enforcement

Project maintainers have the authority to:

Warn contributors

Request changes

Close or decline pull requests

Temporarily or permanently restrict participation

Remove content that violates this Code of Conduct

All decisions will be made with the project's integrity as the priority.

6. Acknowledgment
